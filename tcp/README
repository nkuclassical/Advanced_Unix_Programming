The only one thing that need to be noticed is file access permission. In linux lab, the default umask is 022, so when I want to copy a file, which is 0777, to a destination file, the destination file's access mode become 0755. If we want to get a complete file access permission, change umask to 000 is one way. But it's not suggest, it will open privilege that other person rewrite your own file.

In open() function when oflag contains O_CREAT, it must also explicit the access permission. We can use S_IRUSR|S_IRGRP|S_IROTH or numbers like 0755. This part is in section 4.5 File Access Permissions.

For tcpm, we are asked to use memcpy() and mmap() instead of read() and write(). Actually these two functions are list in section 14.9 Memory-Mapped I/O. My solution is also based on sample code in section 14.9.

Although the big picture was talked in class, some details must be considered. Such as wrong argument number, wrong pathname, overwrite file, destination path without filename, etc. 

In conclusion, as the first coding assignment of CS631, it helps me review C programming and develop procedure.

Thanks a lot!
