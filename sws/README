How to run?
./sws [-dh][-c dir][-i address][-l file][-p port] dir

Teamwork:
Yanqiao Zhan(yzhan14): network\ cgi exe\ paramter
process \NetBSD IPV6\fix bug\git support
Jingxu Wang(jwang81): head\log\read normal file\directory tree present\util
Ao Li(ali12): daemon and debug\http status code\if not
modified part\

Some Tips:
1.If -c specified a path that out of sws root path, then cgi can't be
executed. e.g ./sws -c ~jschauma/cs_html/ -p 8080 ~yzhan14/cs_html.
Even there exists a env.cgi in ~jwchauma/cs_html, but as
~jschauma/cs_html/cgi-bin/env.cgi is out of root path(~yzhan14/cs_html), so
report 403.

2.If a request starts with /cgi-bin/, sws will treat the request as a cgi
request even it request a directory path.
e.g telnet 155.246.89.103 8080
GET /cgi-bin/ HTTP/1.0

We will report 403, since request has not specified a cgi file.

3. abc equals to /abc, and equals to abc/, and equals to /abc/ and equals to //////abc//////
Sws uses a stack to handle all path.
Another case: ./sws ~yzhan14
            telnet 155.246.89.103 8080
            GET ../../../../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.0
After sws simplified client request, request will be converted to GET
/home/yzhan14/etc/passwd. There is not etc/passwd under /home/yzhan14, so
sws will report 404.
